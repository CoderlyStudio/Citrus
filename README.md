## Project Structure

The source code is organized following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern to ensure a clear and scalable structure. Folders are logically divided for easy code navigation and maintenance.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** Run the `git clone` command to get a copy of the project.
2. **Open the Project:** Launch Xcode and open the Citrus project.
3. **Explore the Code:** Take a look at the source code to understand how the project is structured and how alternative icons are managed.
